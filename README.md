# A-Temporal-Academic-Paper-Search-Engine

Area: NLP, Information Retrieval, Scientific Knowledge Graphs
Problem:Researchers can find relevant academic papers, but current search engines don’t reveal the
evolution of ideas—which papers sparked paradigm shifts, how fields matured, or what contributions
were most influential over time.
Tech: SPECTER, FAISS, NetworkX, Node.js, React.js, D3.js
Results: The system accurately identified influential papers by combining citation structure with
semantic embeddings, and visualized a chronological knowledge graph. This enabled users to quickly
grasp key research milestones, improving the quality and depth of literature reviews.
